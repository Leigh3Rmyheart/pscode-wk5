Week five assignment! This week we are to write a code in pseudocode with with numbers.
// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

8 + 5 = 13

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

5
4
5 + 4 = 9

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(9 and  13 are odd although when added together it makes an even 22)

// Exercise 3:

5
1
7
6  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
3+5+1+7+6=22

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing  what they are

(Five numbers 3, 5, 1, 7, 6. Add the five numbers together 3+5+1+7+6=22. Find the mini and the max of the numbers 11 largest and 2 smallest)
