Week five assignment! This week we are to write a code in pseudocode with with numbers.
// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

8 + 5 = 13

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

5
4
5 + 4 = 9

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(9 and  13 are odd although when added together it makes an even 22)
